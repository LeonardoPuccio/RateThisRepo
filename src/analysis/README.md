# Analysis Module

This module contains the repository analysis components that evaluate different aspects of a GitHub repository.

## Structure

- `/insights`: Contains analyzers for identifying repository strengths and recommendations
  - `StrengthsAnalyzer.ts`: Identifies positive aspects of a repository
  - `RecommendationsAnalyzer.ts`: Generates improvement suggestions based on repository metrics

## Core Analysis Components

The analysis module works with the utility classes in `/utils` directory, including:

- `RepositoryAnalyzer`: Main class for collecting and analyzing GitHub repository data
- `ScoreCalculator`: Calculates quality scores based on repository metrics
- `BusFactorCalculator`: Evaluates contributor distribution and project sustainability
- `GitHubAPI`: Handles API requests to GitHub

## Analysis Process

1. Repository data is collected via the GitHubAPI class
2. Raw metrics are transformed into meaningful scores and indicators
3. Insights are generated to identify strengths and recommendations
4. A comprehensive analysis report is produced with quality scores and detailed metrics
